# Quasi-Polynomials library 

This library provides tools for analyzing quasi-polynomials of the form : <br />
$$\sum_{j = 0}^{N} P_j(s) e^{-h_j s}$$
<br />
which can represent characteristic quasi-polynomials associated with time-delay dynamical systems.

## Installation

```bash
pip install QuasiPolyLib
